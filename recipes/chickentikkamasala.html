            <p class="para"> I could write a book about this type food. I don't know where I would be in life if I never experienced this. I've kind of always been a fan of "the spice".
                I remember vividly being at the bowling alley as a kid and me and a friend would go get nachos with cheese. One time they asked if we want jalepenos.
                Not sure at the time if I knew what they were, so it was either explained by my friend or the person taking our order. So we get back to the table and eat our nachos,
                and then we start trying these jalepenos. Instantly it becomes a game. From then on out I would get "spicy" whenever it was an option for food.

                A long while later when I was in college I would hear people talk about Indian food. Eventually, I brought up to my roommate that I've never had it and we got it that night.
                I got chicken curry, which is pretty much (is) just butter chicken. I loved the spices, and the heat. From then on out I was hooked. Right now, I probably get it at least once a month. Nonetheless!
