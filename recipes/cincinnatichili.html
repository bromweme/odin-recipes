            <p class="para"> I think you should've seen this coming. I think it might be heresy for a Cincinnati native to not put Cincinnati Chili in their top 3 favorite meals.
                It's such a classic for the area. We Cincinnatians love our chili. A lot of people call it "not chili", but that's why you put Cincinnati in front of it.
                The main fast food places that people know that specializes in our chili are Gold Star and Skyline. Goldstar being the forgotten chiid. Most people go to Skyline 
                for their chain restaurant choice. But there are plenty of Cincinnati chili restaurants in the area. Emperess Chili (the OG Chili place), Blue Ash Chili, Camp Washington Chili,
                 and Pleasant Ridge Chili (cash only) are just a few examples of were to get gooooood Cincinnati chili.

                People from Cincinnati can talk all day about chili so I will cut it short here. Introducing..... a Cincinnati traditional food, <strong>Cincinnati Chili</strong>.

                <li>5 cups water</li>
                <li>6 oz can of Tomato paste</li>
                <li>1/2 oz baking chocolate (unsweetened - I use Baker's brand)</li>
                <li> 1/4 cup chili powder</li>
                <li> 1 tsp cinnamon</li>
                <li> 1 tsp garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
                <li> 1/4 tsp allspice</li>
                <li> 1/4 tsp ground cloves</li>
                <li> 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, or less, depending on your desired heat level</li>
                <li> 1/8 tsp black pepper</li>
                <li> 3/4 tsp salt</li>
                <li> 1/2 tsp sugar</li>
                <li> 2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li> 1 1/4 lb lean ground beef</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the 5 cups of water in a large pot.  I like to use my dutch oven for this.</li>
                <li>Add the tomato paste and chocolate and heat over medium heat stirring to combine for about 3 minutes. (I stir with a whisk to really break up the tomato paste)</li>
                <li>Add chili powder, cinnamon, garlic powder, cumin, allspice, cloves, red pepper flakes, black pepper, salt, sugar and vinegar.</li>
                <li>Next, crumble the raw ground beef into the pot with your fingers, then use a potato masher, whisk or fork to break up the meat into very fine pieces.</li>
                <li>Turn heat to high to bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Once boiling, turn the heat down to med-low.</li>
                <li>Cook, uncovered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, at a low boil.. stirring occasionally until sauce has thickened quite a bit.</li>
                <li>Serve over thin spaghetti or a hot dog.</li>
            </ol>
